# lists
Simple, non-recursive, chained list library

To compile, simply use the "make" command, and it will compile and run the files on its own.

The listes.h has to structures : struct elem, called Elem, and struct liste, called Liste.

Elem simply contains a pointer to the next element, and an int ; and Liste contains a pointer to the first Elem of a list, and an integer counting the elements in the list.
